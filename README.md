Project Title:
Explore Bikeshare Data

Description:
In this project, Python is used to explore and provide statistics of data from bike share systems for three major cities in the United States - New York City, Chicago, and Washington. Data was imported from the csv files which provides details about the bike usage and the project provides stats based on the filters applied.

Project Data:
chicago.csv - Dataset containing all bikeshare information for the city of Chicago. Data file provided by Udacity.

new_york_city.csv - Dataset containing all bikeshare information for the city of New York. Data file provided by Udacity.

washington.csv - Dataset containing all bikeshare information for the city of Washington. Data file provided by Udacity.
Note: This dataset does not contain data about 'Gender' or 'Birth Year'.

Data Fields:
Start Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:07:57)
End Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53)
Trip Duration (in seconds - e.g., 776)
Start Station (e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave)
End Station (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave)
User Type (Subscriber or Customer)

The Chicago and New York City files also have the following two columns:
Gender
Birth Year


In this project, code is written to compute the following statistics about the data:

1. Popular times of travel:
most common month
most common day of week
most common hour of day

2. Popular stations and trip:
most common start station
most common end station

3. Trip duration:
total travel time
average travel time

4. User info:
counts of each user type

Stats available only for NYC and Chicago:
counts of each gender
earliest, most recent, most common year of birth

Libraries Used:
1. time
2. pandas
3. numpy

Credits:
1. Python documentation
2. Pandas documentation
3. Lectures of Programming for Data Science
4. Starter code, instructions and clean datasets were provided by Udacity as a part of Nanodegree program.
5. Stack Overflow
